Why non-native people learn Chinese:
- adds advantages to professional personal development
- help with business
- has Chinese roots in family
- better communicate with people who speak Chinese
- interested in related culture
- just another skill to master

A lot of people who are not from the Chinese language native areas learn Chinese Simplified (Mandarin), some of the reasons:
- the initiations why they learn Chinese has some strong links to China
- some people think Chinese Simplified is easier to learn compared to Chinese Traditional
- advertising or resources they get

Learning Chinese Simplified means likely a strong tie to China, their education system, culture, idealogy, etc. There are problems and we could do better to address them.

Maybe a more developed Chinese language learning system combines education from places such as Taiwan, China, etc.
